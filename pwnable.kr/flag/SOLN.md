# Solution

Taking a look at the `flag` binary, it is compressed with
UPX. 


It can be decompressed with:
```
$ upx -d ./flag
```


Once decompressed, the flag can be found by looking through strings
in the data segment with `$ strings ./flag` or by disassembling the
binary and setting a breakpoint before the flag is freed.
