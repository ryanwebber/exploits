# Solution

Taking a look at the source code, the program will attempt to
read from a file descriptor identified by the first arguement
minus 0x1234. Passing 0x1234 as the first arguement will use 
`0x1234 - 0x1234` as the file descriptor to read from, which in
linux is stdin. Then, it is simply a matter of piping the 
string "LETMEWIN" into the program to print the flag.
